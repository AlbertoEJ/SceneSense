    <h1>SceneSense - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SceneSense is a camera app that uses on-device AI to describe scenes and answer questions about captured images and videos. Your privacy is our priority: <strong>all processing happens locally on your device</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No images or videos leave your device.</li>
        <li>No text descriptions or chat messages are sent to external servers.</li>
        <li>No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind.</li>
        <li>No user accounts or registration required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera and Microphone</h2>
    <p>SceneSense requires camera access to capture photos and videos for analysis. Microphone access is used only during video recording. All captured media is processed entirely on-device and is not transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>AI Model</h2>
    <p>The AI model (SmolVLM2) runs locally on your device. The model files are downloaded once from Hugging Face upon first launch. After download, no internet connection is required for the AI to function.</p>

    <h2>Translation</h2>
    <p>Translation (English to Spanish) is powered by Google ML Kit's on-device translation. The translation model is downloaded once and runs entirely offline. No text is sent to Google servers for translation.</p>

    <h2>Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>Internet is used only for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial download of the AI model (~500 MB, one-time).</li>
        <li>Initial download of the translation model (one-time, via ML Kit).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After these downloads, the app functions fully offline.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>SceneSense does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SceneSense does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app does not collect information from anyone.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this policy, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
